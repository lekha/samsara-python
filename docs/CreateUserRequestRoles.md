# CreateUserRequestRoles

A role that applies to a user. If the role has a `tagId`, then the role applies for that tag. If there is no `tagId`, then the role applies at the organizational level. A user may have many tag-specific roles, but may only have one organizational role. If the organizational level role has higher privileges than a tag-specific role, then the organizational role privileges will take precedence.
